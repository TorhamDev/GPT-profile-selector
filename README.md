# GPT-profile-selector
let ChatGPT select a profile picture for you!

> this is an assignment but i like the idea!

The idea is you have lots of photos and you don't know which one is good for your profile ðŸ˜•
So instead of using your brain and choosing a profile picture, you ask ChatGPT to select a photo based on images you have on this platform. After that ChatGPT selects one for you and tells you why he selected this image :)
So now you have a profile picture and we have money ðŸ§
